    " performance improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Improved reliability: By running each process in a separate memory space, multiprocessing can improve the \n",
    " reliability of a program by isolating errors or crashes to individual processes, rather than causing the \n",
    " entire program to crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Improved scalability: Multiprocessing can help a program to scale better as the size of the input data or \n",
    " workload increases, by distributing the work across multiple processes or machines.\n",

    "-CPU-bound tasks: Multiprocessing is more suitable for CPU-bound tasks as it allows multiple processors to \n",

    "Multiprocessing and multithreading are both techniques used to execute multiple tasks concurrently. However, \n",
    "there are some key differences between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Memory space: Multiprocessing creates separate memory spaces for each process, whereas multithreading shares \n",
    " the same memory space across all threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Communication and synchronization: Inter-process communication and synchronization in multiprocessing are more \n",
    " complex, as each process runs independently of the others, while in multithreading, communication and synchronization \n",
    " can be simpler, as threads can share the same memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "-CPU-bound vs I/O-bound tasks: Multiprocessing is better suited for CPU-bound tasks, where computation is the bottleneck, \n",
    " while multithreading is better suited for I/O-bound tasks, where waiting for I/O operations is the bottleneck.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Resource usage: Multiprocessing may use more resources, as each process has its own memory space and overhead, while \n",
    " multithreading uses fewer resources as threads share the same memory space and have less overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Fault isolation: In multiprocessing, a crash or error in one process does not affect the others, while in multithreading, \n",
    " a crash or error in one thread can cause the entire program to crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, multiprocessing is better suited for CPU-bound tasks that can benefit from parallelization, while multithreading \n",
    "is better suited for I/O-bound tasks that involve waiting for external operations to complete.\n",

    "A.)Tuples are a data structure in Python that consist of an ordered, immutable collection of elements. Here are the key characteristics of tuples:\n",
    "    1.Ordered: The elements in a tuple have a defined order, and this order is maintained.\n",
    "    2.Immutable: Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed. This means that you cannot add, remove, or modify elements in a tuple.\n",
    "    3.Heterogeneous: Tuples can contain elements of different data types, such as integers, strings, and other objects.\n",
    "    4.Indexed: Each element in a tuple can be accessed using an index, starting from 0 for the first element.\n",
    "    5.Can be nested: Tuples can contain other tuples, allowing for complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "B.)In conclusion, tuples are immutable in Python, meaning that you cannot modify the elements of a tuple once it has been created. This property \n",
    "   makes tuples useful for representing fixed collections of data that you want to protect from changes.\n",
